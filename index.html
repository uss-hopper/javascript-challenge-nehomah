		<p>Dig if you will the picture. Of you and I engaged in a kiss. The sweat of your body covers me. Can you my darling. Can you picture this? Dream, if you can, a courtyard.  An ocean of violets in bloom. Animals strike curious poses. They feel the heat. The heat between me and you. How can you just leave me standing? Alone in a world that's so cold (so cold). Maybe I'm just too demanding. Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold. Maybe you're just like my mother. She's never satisfied (she's never satisfied). Why do we scream at each other? This is what it sounds like. When doves cry. Touch if you will my stomach. Feel how it trembles inside. You've got the butterflies all tied up. Don't make me chase you. Even doves have pride.

Purple rain, purple rain. Purple rain, purple rain. Purple rain, purple rain. I only wanted to see you. Bathing in the purple rain. I never wanted to be your weekend lover. I only wanted to be some kind of friend. Baby, I could never steal you from another. It's such a shame our friendship had to end. Purple rain, purple rain. Purple rain, purple rain. Purple rain, purple rain. I only wanted to see you. Underneath the purple rain. Honey, I know, I know. I know times are changing. It's time we all reach out. For something new, that means you too. You say you want a leader. But you can't seem to make up your mind. I think you better close it. And let me guide you to the purple rain.</p>
