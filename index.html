		<h4>WHEN DOVES CRY</h4>
		<p id="change">Dig if you will the picture. Of you and I engaged in a kiss. The sweat of your body covers me. Can you my darling. Can you picture this? Dream, if you can, a courtyard.  An ocean of violets in bloom. Animals strike curious poses. They feel the heat. The heat between me and you. How can you just leave me standing? Alone in a world that's so cold (so cold). Maybe I'm just too demanding. Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold. Maybe you're just like my mother. She's never satisfied (she's never satisfied). Why do we scream at each other? This is what it sounds like. When doves cry. Touch if you will my stomach. Feel how it trembles inside. You've got the butterflies all tied up. Don't make me chase you. Even doves have pride. How could you just leave me standing?. Alone in…</p>

		 <h4 id=>LET'S GO CRAZY</h4>
		<p id="random">Dearly beloved, we have gathered here today. To get through this thing called life. Electric word life it means forever and that's a mighty long time. But I'm here to tell you there's something else (Go crazy). If you don't like, the world you're living in. Take a look around you at least you got friends. Come on lady for friendly word. She picked up the phone, dropped it on the floor. Ah, ah is all I heard. Are we gonna let the elevator. Bring us down, oh, no let's go . Let's go crazy, let's get nuts. Look for the purple banana. 'Til they put us in the truck, let's go . All excited but we don't know why. Maybe it's 'cause we're all gonna die. And when we do, what's it all for. Better live now before the grim reaper. Come knocking on your door. Are we gonna let the elevator. Bring…</p>

		<h4>PURPLE RAIN</h4>
		<p id="muse">I never meant to cause you any sorrow. I never meant to cause you any pain. I only wanted to one time to see you laughing. I only wanted to see you. Laughing in the purple rain. Purple rain, purple rain. Purple rain, purple rain. Purple rain, purple rain. I only wanted to see you. Bathing in the purple rain. I never wanted to be your weekend lover. I only wanted to be some kind of friend. Baby, I could never steal you from another. It's such a shame our friendship had to end. Purple rain, purple rain. Purple rain, purple rain. Purple rain, purple rain. I only wanted to see you. Underneath the purple rain. Honey, I know, I know. I know times are changing. It's time we all reach out. For something new, that means you too. You say you want a leader. But you can't seem to make up your mind. I think you better close it. And let me guide you to the purple rain.</p>
